# Password-Manager by Aleksandar15

## Overview

This is a password management app. I was certainly excited to have my own password manager released and then got sidetracked with my other projects.


See my project in action as it is [here](https://alek-password-manager.netlify.app)(refresh for the backend on heroku to do its thing).

## Features

- Store a website's title and your password.
### TO BE ADDED:
I am building user authentication feature where upon registration a user will be able to store their password for a particular website (title, e-mail and password).

## Run my project

- Clone this project.
- Navigate (cd) into your project directory.
- Run `npm install` in your command line.
- Create a `config` folder in the root of the project and inside of that folder create a `dev.env` file and write the details of your MySQL database as for user: `MYSQL_USER`, host: `MYSQL_HOST`, password: `MYSQL_PASSWORD` and your database: `MYSQL_DATABASE`.
- Run `npm start` in your command line.
- Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser!
MYSQL_USER
MYSQL_HOST
MYSQL_PASSWORD
MYSQL_DATABASE

## Tech stack
- React.js
